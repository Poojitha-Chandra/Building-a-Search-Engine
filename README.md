Before going to know the code about our search engine,let's know something about *Beautiful Soup*
# <h2>Beautiful Soup installation</h2>
Beautiful Soup installation is done by downloading the code `bs4 zip file` and unzipping the file in the same directory as this file.It contains some python files.If you want to use the Beautiful Soup,then include the import bs4 in the code.
# <h2>Necessity of Beautiful Soup </h2>
Ok then,now assuming that you can import Beautiful Soup!For suppose we have a task of reading some data from net.Then,the duty of Beautiful Soup would be like,it takes the URL from which we want to extract data.BeautifulSoup is smart enough to convert and cleans it up.That means it takes the nasty HTML using parser,which is extremely useful for `web scrapping`.
